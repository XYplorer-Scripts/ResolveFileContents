# ResolveFileContents

**Script to resolve variables within the selected file in [XYplorer](http://xyplorer.com/index.php).**

This script reads the selected items, interpolates variables within their contents, and overwrites the original files with the resolved content.

One useful scenario for this is to place templates containing variables within the [New Items menu](http://www.xyplorer.com/highlights.php#newitems) and use it as normal. Then after using *New Items* this script can be run on the created files to replace the variables within those templates.
